A fan created Pac-Man theme for StepMania 5!
</h1>

# READ THIS FIRST!
DO NOT CHARGE PEOPLE FOR THIS PROJECT! THIS IS A FREE THEME FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY.

Under no circumstances should you or anybody shove this theme onto a public arcade cabinet to make money, that is not allowed, period.

For an authentic 1980 experience, refrain from using any simfiles that rely on background changes or any mod files.
# WARNING!
This theme manipulates game preferences heavily, including disabling Fantastic (W1) timing window and sorting folders. It is recommended you use a separate install of your SM5 choice and simply use the AdditionalSongs feature in the Preferences.ini file, otherwise switching themes will mess up the next used theme unless you reset your Preferences.ini values. This theme is not intended to be a serious theme, as it also removes modifiers, kickin' it old school.
